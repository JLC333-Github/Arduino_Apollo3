  This example shows how to use the EEPROM get and put functions
  to read and write to EEPROM inside Artemis.

  Artemis doesn't actually have EEPROM. Instead we are writing to a protected
  section of flash. 1028 bytes of flash are updated each time a variable is written. 
  This can take up to 30ms.
  
  Page erase takes 15ms
  Write byte takes 30ms - This is much longer than Arduino that takes 3.3ms
  Float write across two words takes 30ms
  Update (no write) takes 1ms

#include <EEPROM.h>

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("EEPROM Examples");

  byte myValue1 = 200;
  EEPROM.put(0, myValue1); //(location, data)
  byte response1;
  EEPROM.get(0, response1);
  Serial.printf("Location %d should be %d: %d\n\r", 0, myValue1, response1);

  int myValue5 = -245000; //Note that ints are 4 bytes on the Artemis
  EEPROM.put(2, myValue5);
  int response5;
  EEPROM.get(2, response5);
  Serial.printf("Location %d should be %d: %d\n\r", 2, myValue5, response5);

  float myValue9 = -7.35;
  EEPROM.put(10, myValue9);
  float response9;
  EEPROM.get(10, response9);
  Serial.printf("Location %d should be %f: %f\n\r", 10, myValue9, response9);
}
